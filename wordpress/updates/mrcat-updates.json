Display categories with descriptions, media and links, in a variety of layouts with many customizable options.</p><p><strong>MR Categories</strong><br>Some content display plugins and CMS do not highlight categories as much as posts. But that could be practicle for a better organization, structure, search engine optimization and a better understanding of the front and backoffice from clients and users.</p><p>'MR Categories' makes it easier and faster to display categories and have your websites structured in ways such as:</p><p>Page with categories > Category page with posts > Post</p>",
        "changelog" : "<p><strong>0.5.0</strong></p><p><strong>New features:</strong></p><ul><li>Items image options using background</li></ul><p><strong>Corrected bugs:</strong></p><ul><li>The 'reveal active' option (used in layouts such as 'Collapsible') was opening the content step by step.</li><li>The Custom layout direction toggle should only be sideways with the options: 'expand active', 'When active hide inactives' or 'Only show subcategories of active'.</li><li>In portrait mode the 'expand active' option (used in layouts such as 'Accordion') sometimes showed an horizontal scroll on bigger width items.</li><li>The 'Menu' layout of the 'Default' theme was confusing when subcategories were on a different page, for this reason this layout now forces the number of items per page to be infinite.</li><li>On the browsers IE and Edge in landscape mode, the 'expand active' option (used in layouts such as 'Accordion') was shrinking the content to fit the visible space on inactive items.</li><li>On the backend the list of items sometimes was not divided into pages, this made the manual order seem wrong but it was correct on the frontend.</li><li>Removed borders from the page toggles 'arrows' when style is enabled.</li><li>The options 'use landscape' and 'use portrait' together with the 'expand active' on the 'Custom' layout, were not working very well and got some revision.</li></ul><p><strong>Improvements</strong></p><p>Around 15 improvements were made, including adjusting the admin style following the changes made to Wordpress 5.3.
