# Mr.Dev.
### Description
A pack of developing tools for Wordpress and Joomla. Use *'MR Widgets / Modules'* to display content with many customizable layouts and options.

### Widgets / Modules
The following widgets / modules initially come with one simple theme with many layouts to choose from. It also includes a custom layout to choose each option and it's possible to develop new custom themes. This is perfect if you already have a website and want to display your content in a new way, while keeping the look & feel of your current template.

#### MR Categories
Mr.Dev. started with the widget/module 'MR Categories' because some *content display plugins* and *CMS* do not highlight categories as much as posts/articles. But that could be practicle for a better organization, structure, search engine optimization and a better understanding of the front and backoffice from clients and users.

'MR Categories' makes it easier and faster to have websites structured in ways such as:\
*Page/Menu with categories > Category page with posts/articles > Post/Article*
