# Mr.Dev.
A pack of developing tools for Wordpress and Joomla. Display content with many customizable layouts and options.

The widget/module initially comes with one simple theme with many layouts to choose from. It also includes a custom layout to choose each option and it's possible to develop new custom themes. This is perfect if you already have a website and want to display your content in a new way, while keeping the look & feel of your current template.

Mr.Dev. starts with categories because some *content display plugins* and *CMS* do not highlight categories as much as posts/articles. But that could be practical for a better organization, structure, search engine optimization and a better understanding of the front and backoffice from clients and users.

This widget/module makes it easier and faster to have websites structured in ways such as:\
*Page/Menu with categories > Category page with posts/articles > Post/Article*
