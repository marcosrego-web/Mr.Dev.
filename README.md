# Mr.Dev.
### Description
A pack of developing tools for content management systems, with *'MR Widgets / Modules'* to display content using many customizable layouts and options.

### Widgets / Modules
#### MR Categories
Mr.Dev. starts with the widget 'MR Categories' for Wordpress, because some content display plugins and even CMS fail to not highlight categories as much as posts/articles. That could be practicle for a better organization, search engine optimization and more friendly for users/clients to understand the front and the backoffice.

'MR Categories' makes it easier and faster to have websites structured in ways such as:\
*Page/Menu with categories > Category page with posts/articles > Post/Article*\
And because of the customizable layouts and themes creation, this widget/module it's also perfect if you already have a website but intend to make a better use of the categories while keeping the look & feel of your current template.
