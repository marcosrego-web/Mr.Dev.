# Mr.Dev.
Mr.Dev. is your provider of developing tools for Wordpress and Joomla!

He brings you a widget/module to display categories, tags, posts/articles and pages with many customizable layouts and options to choose from.
All tools are optional and you can hide parts of the widgets/modules to specific users or roles/groups.

### [Changelog](https://github.com/marcosrego-web/Mr.Dev./releases)
##
### Details
The widget/module initially comes with the themes ‘None’ and ‘Default’.
'Default' has many layouts to choose from including a custom layout to choose each option. It's also possible to develop new custom themes. This is perfect if you already have a website and want to display your content in a new way, while keeping the look & feel of your current template.

Mr.Dev. starts with categories because some *content display plugins* and *CMS* do not highlight categories as much as posts/articles. But that could be practical for a better organization, structure, search engine optimization and a better understanding of the front and backoffice from clients and users.
##
### Compatibility Warning ⚠ 
If you need the widget/module to work properly with Internet Explorer, you'll need to use a [polyfill](https://polyfill.io/v3/) if you are not yet using one. On the full version (Mr.Dev.) you can activate the polyfill from the settings page on Wordpress, to activate on Joomla you can find the option on the 'Advanced' tab of each module (do it only on one module per page).
